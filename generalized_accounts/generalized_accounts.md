# Generalized accounts

Currently, accounts have very little flexibility when it comes to the logic
controlling them, which results in a uniform user experience. This makes
development easier, e.g. a wallet only needs to handle a single method of
accessing accounts, but also ignores that people may have varying needs when it
comes to managing their accounts.
