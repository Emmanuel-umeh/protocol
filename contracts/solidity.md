# The Solidity Language

Ã†ternity supports the Solidity language bytecode and ABI.

For a full description of Solidity see [The Solidity Specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io).


## The Solidity_01 ABI

Note that the Solidity_01 ABI specifies that the create contract initial call returns the actual
bytecode to be stored in the contract state tree to be used for future calls.

See [The Solidity Specification:ABI](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html)
